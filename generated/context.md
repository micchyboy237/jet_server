## What is Live Selling?  
Live selling takes advantage of video streaming technology to connect merchants to shoppers. This practice involves sellers and retailers showcasing their products to customers and patrons and highlighting how it works, and how much it costs.  
Live selling retailers generate buzz around their product and create demand and trust by ensuring their engaging personality and the quality of their items come through during their broadcast. In the Philippines, the usual method used by sellers is this:  
1. Show a product
2. Assign a code for it
3. Reveal the price  
For example, if someone is selling a yellow dress, the seller can say the item code is "Yellow," and it is priced at "Php300."  
Customers, also called "miners" can then comment "yellow mine" on the live, and then message their order details to the seller after the stream has ended.

When people follow your page, they will know whether there is a live coming up, or you have a new item on sale. Therefore, they can set aside time to watch your live selling stream.  
It has more audience  
Facebook Live, among other platforms, is putting live video at the forefront of their features. Because of this, your live content can get more exposure.

You can demonstrate  
Demonstrating is such an important marketing strategy. Through live selling, you can show potential customers how your items can be used, and how they can add value to their lives.  
This is more useful compared to simple product descriptions with accompanying pictures. Live selling also enables your customers to ask questions about the products on the spot.  
It is interactive  
Streaming services are designed to foster interactivity among viewers. This is the next best thing to seeing the products live in physical stores.  
More than that, buyers also have more trust in live videos because the products cannot be edited or photoshopped.

Live selling does not only cater to live viewers. Even customers who missed your live can watch your former videos and buy products that have not been sold.  
Your live content can even be repurposed.  
It fosters a sense of urgency  
Compared to other forms of content, live streaming fosters fear of missing out or FOMO among audiences.  
People will be more motivated to buy immediately because the item may not be there in a few seconds or minutes and they don't want to miss out on it.  
It gives you freedom  
When it comes to live selling, sellers can enjoy more freedom.  
You can go live for 15 minutes or 2 hours. Your strategy can be very commercial, or it can be educational. The sky's the limit.  
It allows you to save money  
One of the best benefits of live selling is it is free. Home-based entrepreneurs and startups can use this strategy to gain more profit.  
If you want to take the extra mile, you can just invest in a tripod, lighting, and a microphone. Of course, it is still possible to livestream even when you don't have these things.
