This practice involves sellers and retailers showcasing their products to customers and patrons and highlighting how it works, and how much it costs.  \nLive selling retailers generate buzz around their product and create demand and trust by ensuring their engaging personality and the quality of their items come through during their broadcast. In the Philippines, the usual method used by sellers is this:  \n1. Show a product\n2. Assign a code for it\n3. Reveal the price  \nFor example, if someone is selling a yellow dress, the seller can say the item code is \"Yellow,\" and it is priced at \"Php300.\"  \nCustomers, also called \"miners\" can then comment \"yellow mine\" on the live, and then message their order details to the seller after the stream has ended.  \n* * *",
