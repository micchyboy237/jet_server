Choosing the best products to sell online is one of the most important steps in building a successful ecommerce business. But with a plethora of options across an endless amount of industries, how do you decide which ones to sell? This guide will discuss why launching an online store can be a lucrative move, what are the most trending products in the Philippines to sell online, and how you can gain a competitive edge over other web stores.

## Why should you launch an ecommerce business?  
Online stores offer entrepreneurs a chance to build a brand with relatively low barriers to entry. Unlike a brick-and-mortar store that requires rent, permits, and licenses (and can take months to launch), you can begin selling online in less than 30 days from your home office. All you need to do to launch an ecommerce storefront is:  
* Choose the product(s) you want to sell.
* Buy a domain and set up web hosting for your ecommerce store.
* Create your ecommerce website.
* Set up an online payment provider and fulfillment.
* Add content and market your brand.  
Of course, the amount of work needed to find the best online store builder and launch an ecommerce store will depend on many things, but it is generally much easier to launch an online store than a physical business.  
The flexibility of web stores is also enticing to many entrepreneurs. You can reach a much larger audience online than with a brick-and-mortar location. This means you can grow your sales exponentially faster than you could with a physical location. You can also sell products 24/7/365, which is not a viable option offline. This versatility and opportunity make ecommerce a great industry in which to build your business. If you follow our step-by-step guide you will see that making your own online store is not as hard as it seems.

## Popular products to sell online FAQ  
### How will the product be manufactured?  
If you intend to make them yourself, you will need to think about the steps required to acquire raw materials. Maybe you plan to use a manufacturer -- if that's the case, you should look to negotiate production based on scale. A way to avoid manufacturing altogether is by reselling goods, which requires partnering with other brands and manufacturers.

### Who is going to purchase your product?  
Some products target a large audience, but you can segment that audience with specific marketing messages. Other products operate within a niche industry that has a limited customer base. Successful ecommerce businesses can be found in both large industries and niche ones. The important thing to note is that they have found a way to effectively communicate their value proposition to their targeted consumers.

### Is the product marketable?  
Onsite and offsite SEO are two important strategies to include in your plan for marketing products online. Most ecommerce businesses do not take the time to write unique and compelling product descriptions for their online products. Moreover, they are not promoting their products on social media or building a diversified link portfolio for their pages. However, executing these two steps can drastically improve the organic rankings of product pages for relevant search terms.

### What products are in high demand right now?  
It's important to understand that demand can shift on almost a daily basis, given the amount of content online from news and influencers. However, some products that may be in high demand right now include:  
* Air purifiers
* Weighted blankets
* Pickleball paddles
* Athleisure clothing
* Rice water shampoo  
Again, it's important to note that consumer demand can vary greatly depending on location, season, and current events.

### How can I find trending products?  
There are lots of ways you can identify trending products. Here are just a few of them:  
* You can start by exploring what people are searching for online. Google Trends is a free tool that shows the popularity of search terms over time. You can compare multiple terms, filter by location, and view related topics and queries to spot products with rising search interest.  
Alternatively, keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush, and Ahrefs provide data on search volume and trends for specific keywords.  
* ECommerce platforms offer valuable insights into current best-sellers too. Amazon updates its list of top-selling products hourly across various categories. Tools like Jungle Scout can help you analyze product demand and competition on Amazon. Similarly, eBay's Explore tool highlights trending items based on recent sales data, providing information on sell-through rates and average prices.  
Another place you can look is Etsy. Known for handmade and vintage goods, the platform releases regular trend reports showcasing top search keywords, emerging product trends, and popular items across multiple niches.  
* Look on social media. It is a goldmine for spotting emerging trends. Monitor popular hashtags, trending topics, and influencer posts on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest. Look for recurring product mentions and high engagement rates on product-related content to gauge consumer interest.
* Use trend spotting websites such as Trend Hunter, Springwise, and PSFK. These platforms curate innovative product ideas and emerging consumer trends, and can help generate product inspiration and identify potential market opportunities.
* Finally, read industry reports from market research firms like eMarketer, Mintel, and NPD Group. These reports offer in-depth insights into consumer buying habits and product trends. Although these reports can be costly, they provide valuable information on market demand and future growth potential.

### What is the most bought item ever?  
According to multiple sources, the highest-selling product of all time is Sony Playstation consoles. Sony has collectively sold more than 520 million consoles between PlayStation 1-5. And, believe it or not, people are still seeking to purchase PlayStation consoles 1, 2, 3, and 4 on sites like eBay as well!
