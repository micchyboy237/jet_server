Unlike a brick-and-mortar store that requires rent, permits, and licenses (and can take months to launch), you can begin selling online in less than 30 days from your home office. All you need to do to launch an ecommerce storefront is:  \n* Choose the product(s) you want to sell.\n* Buy a domain and set up web hosting for your ecommerce store.\n* Create your ecommerce website.\n* Set up an online payment provider and fulfillment.\n* Add content and market your brand.  \nOf course, the amount of work needed to find the best online store builder and launch an ecommerce store will depend on many things, but it is generally much easier to launch an online store than a physical business.  \nThe flexibility of web stores is also enticing to many entrepreneurs. You can reach a much larger audience online than with a brick-and-mortar location. This means you can grow your sales exponentially faster than you could with a physical location. You can also sell products 24/7/365, which is not a viable option offline. This versatility and opportunity make ecommerce a great industry in which to build your business.

Case in point - there wasn't any significant YoY growth in products like water shoes, sweaters, cat beds, candles, blankets, and beet gummies. Instead, there was a steady stream of search volume for shoppers seeking them all year.  \nHowever, they had significant spikes in traffic at certain points in the year.  \nFor example, candles, sweaters, and blankets had a healthy spike in interest during December - likely due to people searching for holiday gifts. Water shoes on the other hand had a spike in the summer - likely due to an increased interest in water activities to beat the heat.",
