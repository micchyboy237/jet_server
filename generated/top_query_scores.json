This practice involves sellers and retailers showcasing their products to customers and patrons and highlighting how it works, and how much it costs.  \nLive selling retailers generate buzz around their product and create demand and trust by ensuring their engaging personality and the quality of their items come through during their broadcast. In the Philippines, the usual method used by sellers is this:  \n1. Show a product\n2. Assign a code for it\n3. Reveal the price  \nFor example, if someone is selling a yellow dress, the seller can say the item code is \"Yellow,\" and it is priced at \"Php300.\"  \nCustomers, also called \"miners\" can then comment \"yellow mine\" on the live, and then message their order details to the seller after the stream has ended.  \n* * *\n\n\nWhy Live Selling Works in the Philippines?\nPros & Cons of Live Selling in the Philippines"

However, that doesn't mean it is perfect. You are bound to run into glitches that may sauce warped sounds, blurry videos, or lagging.  \nThis may cause you to lose viewers.  \nIt's not for everyone  \nLive selling can only be effective for people who know how it works. You may face some obstacles as you are filming your live video such as accidentally dropping your phone, or even fumbling over your words.  \nWhen it comes to live selling, a lot of sellers get pressured because it seems there should be no room for mistakes.  \nIt doesn't offer privacy for buyers  \nWhen it comes to live selling, the only way buyers can communicate with the seller is through the chat function. Unless your customers message you privately, everyone else will see their comment as well.  \nThis may be a deal breaker for customers who want to buy expensive items such as jewelry, and other sensitive items.  \nIt can be censored  \nLive selling can be subject to censorship. If someone reports your video or says it violated community standards, it could immediately be stopped.  \nNot all sellers have the time to hold a live session  \nEach day, entrepreneurs are bombarded with so many things to do. If their schedules are always full, it's hard to schedule and do a livestream.  \nAside from that, it can also be hard to know the time when your target audience is online.  \nIt can have low engagement  \nWhile live selling can truly increase your audience, it can also be notorious for low or lack of engagement.  \nThis is common for newbies who do not know how to deliver an awesome live stream experience yet.  \n* * *\n\n"

Here are some essential things to consider:  \nCamera and microphone  \nWhile most smartphone cameras work great for live selling, it's recommended to get an external microphone for better audio quality.  \nFor businesses with bigger budgets, investing in a high-quality camera can also enhance the overall viewing experience.  \nLighting  \nGood lighting can make a significant difference in the quality of your stream and can help your products shine.  \nConsider investing in ring lights, softbox lights, or other equipment to make sure you're well-lit and your products are well-illuminated.  \nBackground and ambiance  \nChoose a clean and clutter-free background that won't distract from your products. You can also add some decor or props that compliment your brand and products, such as banners or themed backdrops.  \nMost livestream apps allow you to put a green screen filter on your livestream. You can take advantage of this feature to create a more engaging background.  \nInternet connection  \nA stable and reliable internet connection is essential for a smooth and uninterrupted live selling experience.  \nMake sure you have a strong and fast connection before going live. Consider using a wired connection or upgrading your internet plan if necessary.\n\n"
