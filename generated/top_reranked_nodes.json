Here are some of the most commonly asked questions (and answers) related to Live Selling in the Philippines:  \nDo I need a business permit to do live selling in the Philippines?  \nYes, to operate legally, you should secure the necessary business permits and licenses from local government units and other relevant agencies.  \nHow do I price my products for live selling?  \nConsider factors like product cost, competitor pricing, and perceived value. Offering promotional prices or discounts during live sessions can also attract buyers.  \nWhat equipment do I need to start live selling?  \nAt a minimum, you'll need a smartphone or camera, a stable internet connection, good lighting, and clear audio equipment.  \nHow do I handle negative comments or trolls during my live session?  \nStay professional. Address genuine concerns and consider using platform moderation tools to manage or mute disruptive viewers.  \nCan I do live selling anywhere?  \nWhile you can technically go live from anywhere, it's best to choose a quiet location with good lighting and minimal distractions.  \nHow do I ensure timely delivery of products sold during live sessions?  \nPartner with reliable courier services, provide tracking information to buyers, and maintain clear communication regarding delivery timelines.  \nWhat if the product is damaged during shipping?  \nIt's essential to have a return and exchange policy in place. Communicate this policy clearly to your buyers.  \nHow do I build trust with my viewers?  \nBe genuine, provide accurate product descriptions, conduct live demos, and share testimonials or reviews from past customers.  \nIs there a limit to how long I can go live?  \nDifferent platforms have varying limits. For instance, Facebook Live allows streams up to 8 hours, while Instagram Live has a 60-minute limit.  \nHow do I promote my live selling sessions?  \nAnnounce your sessions in advance on social media, use email marketing, collaborate with influencers, or consider paid advertising.  \nAre there any legal considerations for live selling in the Philippines?  \nYes, aside from business permits, you should also be aware of consumer rights, advertising standards, and e-commerce regulations in the Philippines.  \nHow do I handle payments securely?  \nConsider using established payment gateways or platforms that offer integrated payment solutions to ensure secure transactions.  \nCan I collaborate with other sellers or brands during live selling?  \nAbsolutely!

You are bound to run into glitches that may sauce warped sounds, blurry videos, or lagging.  \nThis may cause you to lose viewers.  \nIt's not for everyone  \nLive selling can only be effective for people who know how it works. You may face some obstacles as you are filming your live video such as accidentally dropping your phone, or even fumbling over your words.  \nWhen it comes to live selling, a lot of sellers get pressured because it seems there should be no room for mistakes.  \nIt doesn't offer privacy for buyers  \nWhen it comes to live selling, the only way buyers can communicate with the seller is through the chat function. Unless your customers message you privately, everyone else will see their comment as well.  \nThis may be a deal breaker for customers who want to buy expensive items such as jewelry, and other sensitive items.  \nIt can be censored  \nLive selling can be subject to censorship. If someone reports your video or says it violated community standards, it could immediately be stopped.  \nNot all sellers have the time to hold a live session  \nEach day, entrepreneurs are bombarded with so many things to do. If their schedules are always full, it's hard to schedule and do a livestream.  \nAside from that, it can also be hard to know the time when your target audience is online.  \nIt can have low engagement  \nWhile live selling can truly increase your audience, it can also be notorious for low or lack of engagement.  \nThis is common for newbies who do not know how to deliver an awesome live stream experience yet.  \n* * *",
